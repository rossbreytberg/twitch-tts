# Twitch TTS
 
Twitch TTS (text-to-speech) will read your or any other channel's Twitch chat out loud. Just enter a Twitch channel name to get started! Perfect for streamers who want to have a natural conversation with their viewers rather than squinting at a text chat.

- Automatically assigns different voices to different viewers. To get more voices, install additional Windows language packs for free.
- Includes ability to create word filters to omit or substitute words you don't want read out loud.
